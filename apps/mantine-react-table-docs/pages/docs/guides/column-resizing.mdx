## Column Resizing Feature Guide

Mantine React Table lets you easily change the default widths (sizes) of columns and has a built-in column resizing draggable handle feature.

### Relevant Table Options

<TableOptionsTable
  onlyOptions={
    new Set([
      'columnResizeMode',
      'defaultColumn',
      'enableColumnResizing',
      'layoutMode',
      'onColumnSizingChange',
      'onColumnSizingInfoChange',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant Column Options

<ColumnOptionsTable
  onlyOptions={new Set(['enableResizing', 'maxSize', 'minSize', 'size'])}
/>

### Relevant State

<StateOptionsTable
  onlyOptions={new Set(['columnSizing', 'columnSizingInfo'])}
/>

### Change Default Column Widths

#### Column Size

This was also covered in the [Data Columns Guide](/docs/guides/data-columns), but we'll cover it again here.

You can change the width of any column by setting its `size` option on the column definition. `minSize` and `maxSize` are also available to enforce limits during resizing.

```jsx
const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'id',
    header: 'ID',
    size: 50, //small column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'username',
    header: 'Username',
    minSize: 100, //min size enforced during resizing
    maxSize: 200, //max size enforced during resizing
    size: 180, //medium column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'email',
    header: 'Email',
    size: 300, //large column
  },
];
```

You may notice, however, that the column sizes might not change as much as you would expect. This is because the browser treats `<th>` and `<td>` elements differently with in a `<table>` element by default.

You can improve this slightly by changing the table layout to `fixed` instead of the default `auto` in the `mantineTableProps`.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  mantineTableProps: {
    style: {
      tableLayout: 'fixed',
    },
  },
});
```

The columns will still try to increase their width to take up the full width of the table, but the columns that do have a defined size will have their width respected more.

For further reading on how table-layout `fixed` vs `auto` works, we recommend reading this [blog post](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/table-layout/) by CSS-Tricks.

If you are using either virtualization features or have the layoutMode set to `"grid"`, another option is to turn off flex grow for both the table head and body cells. [You can see this down below at the bottom of this page](#disable-column-growing)

#### Default Column

By default, columns will have the following size properties defined:

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  defaultColumn: { minSize: 40, maxSize: 1000, size: 180 }, //units are in px (these are the default values)
});
```

You can modify the default column widths by setting the `defaultColumn` table option.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  defaultColumn: {
    minSize: 20, //allow columns to get smaller than default
    maxSize: 9001, //allow columns to get larger than default
    size: 260, //make columns wider by default
  },
});
```

### Enable Column Resizing Feature

`enableColumnResizing` is the boolean table option that enables the column resizing feature.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  enableColumnResizing: true,
});
```

You can disable specific columns from being resizable by setting the `enableResizing` column option to false in their respective column definition.

> When Column Resizing is enabled, a CSS `table-layout: fixed` style is automatically added to the `<table>` element in order to make the browser respect the widths of the columns more. (Unless layoutMode is set to `"grid"`)

#### Column Resize Mode

The default `columnResizeMode` is `onChange`, which means that column resizing will occur immediately as the user drags the column resize handle. If you are running into performance issues because of many other enabled features, you might want to set the `columnResizeMode` to `onEnd` instead. This will make the column resizing only occur after the user has finished dragging the column resize handle and released their mouse.

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  enableColumnResizing: true,
  columnResizeMode: 'onEnd',
});
```

#### Disable Column Growing

If you want to prevent the columns from growing to fill the width of the table, use this flexbox trick when the layoutMode is `"grid"`:

```jsx
const table = useMantineReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  enableColumnResizing: true,
  layoutMode: 'grid',
  mantineTableHeadCellProps: {
    style: {
      flex: '0 0 auto',
    },
  },
  mantineTableBodyCellProps: {
    style: {
      flex: '0 0 auto',
    },
  },
});
```
